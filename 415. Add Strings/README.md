# 415. Add Strings

Problem Description

Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2, represented as strings, return their sum as a string.

#

# Constraints:

You cannot use any built-in library for handling large integers (like BigInteger).
You cannot convert the entire strings directly into integers.
1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 10^4
num1 and num2 consist only of digits.
num1 and num2 do not have leading zeros, except for the number zero itself.

# Examples

Example 1:
Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"

Example 2:
Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"

Example 3:
Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"
