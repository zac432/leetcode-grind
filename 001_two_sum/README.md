# 001. Two Sum

## Problem
Given an array of integers 
ums and an integer 	arget, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to 	arget.

You may assume each input has exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

## Solutions

### Brute Force
- Check all pairs.
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)

### Hash Map
- Use a dictionary to find complements efficiently.
- Time complexity: O(n)
- Space complexity: O(n)
