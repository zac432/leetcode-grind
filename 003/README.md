# Palindrome Number

## Problem Location

- Found on LeetCode: **Problem #9 – Palindrome Number**
- Checks if an integer reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Problem Description

Given an integer `x`, return **true** if `x` is a palindrome, or **false** otherwise.

### Examples

- `121` → `true`, reads the same forwards and backwards.
- `-121` → `false`, reads as "121-" which isn’t the same.
- `10` → `false`, reads as "01" backwards.

## Approach Hints (Don’t scroll the next line if you want to solve it fully on your own!)

1. Think: _How would you check if something reads the same backwards?_
2. Step-by-step plan:
   - Get the input as a string.
   - Reverse it.
   - Compare the reversed version with the original.
   - Handle negative values or edge cases tomorrow.
